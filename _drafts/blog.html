<p>I've never been much one for blogging––I've always romanticized myself within such lofty journalistic terms of objectivity that the idea of journaling my unsubstantiated personal opinions on the world seemed somehow to undermine my seemingly nonpartisan stance. Not to mention, I often just plain don't have time.</p>
<p>But lately I've been rethinking that traditionalist mindset. While I most of all want to report the news as a journalist, that shouldn't prevent me from offering thoughtful analysis on issues I find relevant as a citizen. I am an observer of the public sphere, but I can't deny that I'm inevitably also a participant in it.</p>
<p>Most of all</p>
