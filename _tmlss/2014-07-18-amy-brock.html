  testimonial_text: "I was privileged to work with Carl on several collaborative social
    media projects during his time with the Savannah Morning News. His innovative
    ideas and technical skills played an integral role in how information was communicated
    at key events in Savannah for visitors such as the 189th St. Patrick's Day Parade
    and Festival. \n\nCarl developed digital systems to establish a central calendar
    and revamped website and smartphone app for DoSavannah that put the Savannah Morning
    News on the map as a trusted resource for mainstream and alt events in the area
    that appealed to locals and visitors. \n\nCarl's ability to complete projects
    under tight deadlines and keep a positive attitude made him an enjoyable partner
    to work with and I enjoyed collaborating on special projects and promotions with
    him!"
