  testimonial_text: "Carl is a terrific digital mind. He has proven his fluency in
    several critical web development languages - HTML5, CSS, Javascript and PHP -
    and he uses those skills to craft engaging, intuitive digital projects. \n\nBetter
    still, Carl is fully capable of disseminating his knowledge to his team and coworkers.
    He is no closet-and-dark-room developer; he can lead a team from concept to finished
    project. \n\nAnd like any good journalist, he's detail oriented and deadline driven."
