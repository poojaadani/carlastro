    I am a reporter for the Daily Telegraph in London but knew Carl Lewis when we studied together at Oxford University.
    We both worked on The Oxford Student newspaper, where I served as reporter and news editor, rising to become editor and then head of investigations.
    In those latter two roles, Carl worked alongside me as reporter and news editor and it is a mark of his character that he was both the best colleague and my toughest competition on the staff.
    Carl put in long hours and they paid off with splash af^er splash, several of which were picked up by national
    newspapers. One of these, which appeared in the Daily Mail, credited Carl as joint reporter - and deservedly so given the piece was almost all his own woric.
    He was enthusiastic and lively, a great team player keen to encourage more junior members of staff. But perhaps what made the greatest impression was his ability to temper tenacity with empathy: he was determined to get the
    story but also to understand his sources and to act with impeccable ethics.
    I now work for one of Britain's biggest daily papers and I have rarely encountered people of such quality as Carl. I am confident that he would exceed your expectations.
